# BAMBAM

The Behavior and Advanced Mobility Big Access Model (BAMBAM) is a mobility research platform for scalable access modeling. The process begins with a grid defined at some spatial granularity (e.g., census block or 1 km grid) and a variety of travel configurations. For each grid cell and configuration, the platform executes constrained searches, uses the results to index points of interest (POI), and aggregates the findings to the grid level. It provides researchers access through R or Python running on HPC. The platform automates the import and merging of datasets from diverse sources including data.gov (with automatic merging of Tiger/Lines geometries), OpenStreetMaps, OvertureMaps, and GTFS. It is built upon RouteE Compass, a scalable, energy-aware route planner written in Rust, extended to model multiple travel modes.
